Welcome to the Zero Trust Day 2023! We are very excited to see you here and hope you will enjoy the day and will find many useful insights and ideas to take back to your organization.

<!-- We aim to provide you with the knowledge and tools to start your Zero Trust journey as well as to help you to understand the challenges and opportunities that come with it. In the end we hope that today you will be able to take the first steps towards a Zero Trust environment. Whether that be by implementing a Zero Trust architecture, by starting to implement Zero Trust principles or by starting to implement Zero Trust technologies. -->
